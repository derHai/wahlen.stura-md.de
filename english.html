The elections for the student council, the student council of a faculty and the student representatives in the academic senate and the faculty council are held annually. Every student who is enrolled at the Otto-von-Guericke-University can stand as a candidate for the elections and has the right to vote. With your vote you can support students who you think will best represent and enforce you interests in the different committees.
	<br><br>
The student candidates are organized in groups. Each group has their own set of goals. The student representatives are elected through a personalized proportional representation electoral system. According to the number of votes the groups will receive a number of seats in the committees. The seats are giving to the candidates in the group that received the most votes. If there is only one group standing for a committee then the candidates are elected directly.
